		<p>The US Department of Energy National Science Bowl is a competition that tests knowledge in with multiple-choice and short-answer questions from all areas of science: biology, chemistry, physics, geology, astronomy, energy, and math. Though team members always score points for their team, they will answer questions both individually (Toss-Up) and collaboratively (Bonus).</p>
		<p>Questions are given in a fast-paced, Jeopardy-style elimination tournament. This requires you to think on your feet and make approximations in your head, so that you can respond as quickly as possible.</p>
		<p>The Livermore Sandia Regional competition took place last year at Las Positas College, and Amador sent one team.</p>
