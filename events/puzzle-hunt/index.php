		<p>The Bay Area Puzzle Hunt is a regional competition held at Stanford University. Last year, 14&nbsp;Pleasanton teams participated in Puzzle Hunt, each given two sets of puzzles, a room at the Stanford Law School, and access to the Internet. Throughout the day, team members collaborated to solve the puzzles while eating pizza, exploring the campus, and having a good time.</p>
		<p>Here&rsquo;s the format for the Puzzle Hunt:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Each team is given two sets of puzzles and two meta-puzzles.</li>
			<li>The answers to the first set of puzzles are used to solve the first meta-puzzle.</li>
			<li>The answers to the second set of puzzles, along with the answer to the first meta-puzzle, are used to solve the second meta puzzle.</li>
			<li>The team that solves the most puzzles at the end of the day wins.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Of all the Science Team events, this one is rather unique: it doesn&rsquo;t require prerequisite classes or special knowledge. In fact, we&rsquo;ve found that there is no way to study for Puzzle Hunt, because the puzzles cover diverse topics. From Facebook to webcomics, NFL teams to Harry Potter spells, a strong Puzzle Hunt team needs members with knowledge from just about everywhere.</p>
